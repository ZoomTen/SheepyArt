# Untitled Classic-DeviantArt Clone

Flask practice app.

It's supposed to look like the 2008 layout, but even I don't remember
what that looked like. It might end up looking like an amalgamation of
2008 and 2010 dA. The VidLii of DeviantArt? nah.

Currently watching a dozen or so Flask tutorials,
including Corey Schafer's series - you'll see once you go into
my commit history >_<

## Run
You're gonna need `pipenv` for this. And Python 3.

Run `pipenv install`, then `pipenv run python main.py`.
